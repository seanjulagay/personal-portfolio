          I’m a fresh graduate of De La Salle University - Dasmarinas that’s
          currently indulging in design, development, and all about making
          things look sleek, stylish, and responsive! My other backgrounds
          revolve around game development and UI/UX design. Currently, I make
          side projects to improve my skills and hopefully become a full-stack
          developer in the near future.

          I’ve worked with different software and languages over the course of
          my degree, here are some of them:

      </div>

  );
